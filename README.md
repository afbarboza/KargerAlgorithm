# Karger's Algorithm - General Description
The Karger's Algorithm is a Monte Carlo method to handle the problem of global minimum cut in a undirected connected graph G = (V,E). It is a randomized algorithm, which means its behavior is defined not only by the input, but also by randomly generated numbers. It was created by PhD David Karger in 1993, at Stanford University.
